Controls:
Use A and D to move left and right. W to jump. Use R to interact with objects.

Bugs:
-If there are multiple enemies in a level, only the one that the player dies to will reset, and the rest will not.
-Occasionally, jumping onto the edge of a platform will reset the playerâ€™s jump, making them jump higher than they should be able to.
